    <h2 class="hobby">My Favorite Hobby/Activity</h2>
    <p class="hobby_l">One of my favorite hobby/activity is going paintballing. Paintballing is the sport of using high powered paint guns that shoot paintballs out of them.
        The objective is usually to get the other team out. Getting "out" means that someone on the enemy team shoots you and the paintball breaks on your body. 
        The pain of getting hit by one of these can sometimes be a lot, but overall it is a very fun activity. 
    </p>
    <h2 class="fact">Fun Fact</h2>
    <p class="fact_p">I was named after the movie character Maximus Decimus Meridius from Gladiator!</p>
